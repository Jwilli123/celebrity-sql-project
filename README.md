# Celebrity SQL Project 🎬💍

This is a small project I built as part of a Khan Academy SQL exercise. The prompt encouraged me to create multiple tables from scratch and practice using SQL `JOIN`s — including a self join to show relationships like marriage!

### 📋 What the script does:

- Creates a `persons` table with names, ages, and relationship connections
- Creates an `occupations` table with types of jobs (actor, singer, author)
- Creates a linking table `persons_occ` for a many-to-many relationship between people and occupations
- Demonstrates SQL JOINs including:
  - Inner joins
  - Self joins

### Key SQL Skills Practiced:
- Table creation with primary keys and foreign keys
- Data insertion (`INSERT INTO`)
- INNER JOIN and many-to-many JOINs
- SELF JOIN to find who’s married to who
- ORDER BY clause for sorting results

### 💡 What I learned:

- Designing relational databases
- Writing SQL JOINs
- Data normalization (many-to-many relationship)
- Practicing in SQLite

You can run the SQL script in any SQLite environment to see the database in action!
